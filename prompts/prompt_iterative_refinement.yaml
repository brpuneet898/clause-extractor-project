  Apply Iterative Refinement Approach:

  1st Pass:
  - Do a rough scan to identify potential clauses.
  - Extract clause content without worrying about perfect names.

  2nd Pass:
  - Refine clause names based on legal standards.
  - Group or split clauses logically if necessary.

  Final Pass:
  - Review formatting, clause names, and descriptions carefully.
  - Make sure output is clean, precise, and uses content directly from the contract.

  Output Structure:
  - Document Type: <document_type>
  - Clause 1: <Clause Name> - <Clause Content>
  - Clause 2: <Clause Name> - <Clause Content>
