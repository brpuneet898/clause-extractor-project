  Extract the clauses from the following contract text.

  Your Task:
  - Read the full contract text carefully.
  - Identify individual clauses either by explicit clause names or by understanding the context.
  - If a clause name is provided, use it directly. If it is missing, assign an appropriate legal clause name based on standard contract terminology.
  - Ensure that the description of the clause is taken directly and only from the contract text. Do not invent or hallucinate content.
  - Format your answer strictly as follows:

    - Document Type: <document_type>
    - Clause 1: <Clause Name> - <Clause Content>
    - Clause 2: <Clause Name> - <Clause Content>
    - ...

  Contract Text:
